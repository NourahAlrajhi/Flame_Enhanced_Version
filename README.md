Can't decide where to go? 


Flame project is on a mission to bring families and friends closer with trustworthy recommendations given by your chosen ones on a social map of recommendations. Taking seconds to set up, you can easily save and share your favorite restaurants, activities, attractions, places to stay, stores, shops and more with friends!                                                                                                                                                                 

Whether you love to be a local, or are trying to travel the globe, use the map and check what recommendations are nearby or explore friends recommendations from all across the world in an interactive map view which can be filtered by preference.
